# CSED703 Assignment 1 MNIST Classification Practice

## Environment

The code was developed and tested on a Linux environment, with following dependencies.

* Pytorch 1.0.1
* CUDA 10
* CuDNN 7

If this code does not work on your system, you can try running the code
in our Docker image. Install nvidia-docker, `cd` into `docker/` and run `build_and_runbash.sh`.

## Running test on pre-trained model

`python3 test.py`

This will print classification accuracy on MNIST test set with model 
loaded from the latest checkpoint in `checkpoint/` directory.

## Running training from scratch

run `./train.sh`. This will remove all checkpoint in `checkpoints/`
